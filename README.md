# SEPP-Mockup 
The mockup of the application is outlined in our main document... 
This is part of a coursework project for my degree at the `University Of Birmingham`. This is part of the software engineering (year 2) module of my computer science course.

The mockup is just a prototype design-wise, no actual logic is within the app. 

- This uses `SwiftUI`.
- The mockup has a library dependency `LoremSwiftum` which enables the application to generate various types of fake data, such as names, emails, website links, paragraphs, sentences, etc.
- I chose to do this and make the mockup so comprehensive as it allowed me to apply what I am personally good at to help the group as a whole. Group work is always about delegation, finding what everyone is good at to produce the best possible document.
